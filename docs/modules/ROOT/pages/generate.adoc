= Automatic generation

The `graph-compile` tool provided as part of the `@amxx/graphprotocol-utils` package can be used to automatically generate tailor made schema and manifest for your application. Modules implemented as part of OpenZeppelin subgraph are compatible with this.

== Describe your application

For schema and manifest to be generated, you will have to provide a description of the contract you wish to index.

Here is an example of configuration file that indexed 6 contracts on mainnet:

[source,json]
----
{
  "output": "generated/sample.",
  "chain": "mainnet",
  "datasources": [
    { "address": "0xA3B26327482312f70E077aAba62336f7643e41E1", "startBlock": 11633151, "module": [ "erc20",    "accesscontrol" ] },
    { "address": "0xB1C52075b276f87b1834919167312221d50c9D16", "startBlock":  9917641, "module": [ "erc721",   "ownable"       ] },
    { "address": "0x799DAa22654128d0C64d5b79eac9283008158730", "startBlock":  9917642, "module": [ "erc721",   "ownable"       ] },
    { "address": "0xC76A18c78B7e530A165c5683CB1aB134E21938B4", "startBlock":  9917639, "module": [ "erc721",   "ownable"       ] },
    { "address": "0x001d1cd0bcf2e9021056c6fe4428ce15d977cfe0", "startBlock": 11127634, "module": [ "erc1155",  "ownable"       ] },
    { "address": "0x3d85004fa4723de6563909fabbcafee509ee6a52", "startBlock": 12322496, "module": [ "timelock", "accesscontrol" ] }
  ]
}
----

Each contract is represented as a datasource, with an address, an (optional) start block, and a list of features.

== Generate schema and manifest

This configuration file can compiled using the following command

[source,bash]
----
npx graph-compiler \
  --config sample.json \
  --include node_modules/@openzeppelin/subgraphs/src/datasources \
  --export-schema \
  --export-subgraph
----

Note that in our example, the OpenZeppelin subgraph package was installed using NPM, which means the module descriptions are in `@openzeppelin/subgraphs/src/datasources`. This path must be added using the `--include` command so the compiler can find them.

This will produce two file, following the `output` parameter provided in the configuration file:

- `generated/sample.schema.graphql` contains a tailor made schema, that contains only the entity requiered by the indexed modules.
- `generated/sample.subgraph.yaml` contains the subgraph manifest.

== Deploy your subgraph

In order to deploy your subgraph to the hosted service, or to any other graphnode, you will have to create it first. This operation is documented https://thegraph.com/docs/deploy-a-subgraph[here]. Once this is done, you can compile and deploy the produced subgraph using the `graph-cli` tools:

[source,bash]
----
npx graph-cli codegen generated/sample.subgraph.yaml
npx graph-cli build generated/sample.subgraph.yaml
npx graph-cli deploy                      \
  --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/   \
  --node https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ \
  username/subgraphname                   \
  generated/sample.subgraph.yaml
----
